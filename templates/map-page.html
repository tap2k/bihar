            Stories are the embodiment of our unique experiences and journeys, and are our primary way of remembering the past. Represent provides a platform for the sharing of stories of all types, including poems, songs, myths, legends and folktales, from all places and people. 
          </p><p>
            Our first collection of stories is from the state of Bihar.  Using multiple dialects and modalities, they tell us about the culture and history of this ancient place using stories and songs.  If you would prefer to stream these stories, they are also hosted on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/representorg/sets/stories-of-bihar">soundcloud</a>.  We hope you enjoy this opportunity to explore the magical world of stories.
