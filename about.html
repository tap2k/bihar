			Stories are the embodiment of our unique experiences and journeys, provide the narrative behind our myths, legends and folktales, and are our primary way of remembering the past. Represent provides a platform for the sharing of stories of all types, from all places and people. 
			<br/><br/>
			<b>Narrators are listed by name on their respective stories. They retain all rights to their stories, including in their spoken, transcripted and translated forms. All narrators have given their oral consent for recording and publishing their stories. The artwork and photos used with the stories are paid commissioned work.</b>  
			<br/><br/>
			Our next collection of stories is from the state of Gujarat. Through a variety of dialects and modalities, they tell us about the culture and history of Gujarat using stories and songs. If you would prefer to stream these stories, they are also on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/representorg/sets/stories-of-bihar">Soundcloud</a>. We hope you enjoy the opportunity to explore this ancient land.
