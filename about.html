			Stories are the embodiment of our unique experiences and journeys, provide the narrative behind our myths, legends and folktales, and are our primary way of remembering the past. The Represent project seeks to provide a platform for the sharing of stories of all types, from all places and people. 
			<br/><br/>
			<b>All narrators are listed by name on their respective stories. They retain all rights to their stories, including in their spoken, transcripted and translated forms.</b>  
			<br/><br/>
			Our first collection of stories are from across the state of Bihar. Through a variety of dialects and modalities, they tell us about the culture and history of Bihar using stories and songs. We hope you enjoy this, our first collection, as we collectively explore this ancient land. 
			<br/><br/>
			This is a project of the Representation Foundation, a registered 501c3 charity. If you would like to make a donation to support our efforts, or like to submit a story to our archive, or have any questions or ideas, please email us at <a href="info@represent.org">info@represent.org</a>.
